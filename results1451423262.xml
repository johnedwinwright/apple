As a Creative, you’re the foundation of the Apple Store’s welcoming environment that invites individuals to share their ideas and learn how to bring their visions to life.

      <posDescription>As a Creative, your main role at the Apple Store is that of instructor, whether guiding small groups to learn or helping individuals complete projects.

But you're also an excellent listener, taking the time to understand what each user hopes to achieve or learn. By adjusting your teaching style to each user's individual skill level, you maximize his or her understanding and your own time. You recognize that purchasing a new product can sometimes help customers attain their goals. You spend much of your time leading scheduled training sessions, but you're still comfortable interacting with store customers between those sessions. You're proud to enrich the lives of others  - whether customers or team members  - through teaching, in the way only a Creative can. </posDescription>

You use your presentation skills to act as a facilitator, helping users get set up, get trained, and get going. But you're also an excellent listener, taking the time to understand what each user hopes to achieve or learn. By adjusting your teaching style to each user's individual skill level, you maximize his or her understanding and your own time. You recognize that purchasing a new product can sometimes help customers attain their goals. You spend much of your time leading scheduled training sessions, but you're still comfortable interacting with store customers between those sessions. You're proud to enrich the lives of others  - whether customers or team members  - through teaching, in the way only a Creative can. </reqDescription>
